Day #3 100days of code

Today I learned about Space Complexity in JS and how it is different from time. 
Most primitives are constant space (O)1 space
Strings require O(n) space  - where n is the string length
Reference types are generally O(n) where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects)


Logarithms-inverse of exponentiation. 
roughly measures the number of times you can divide a number by its base before you get to a value that is less than or equal to one. 

log(8) = 3  (we are omitting the base which is 2 since that is the most common base we are saying that log means that it has a base of 2)
so we are asking 2 to what power is 8?

Certain searching algorithms have logarithmic time complexity. 
Efficient solving alogrithms involve logarithms
Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity.
