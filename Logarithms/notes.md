Day #3 100days of code

Today I learned about Space Complexity in JS and how it is different from time.
Most primitives are constant space (O)1 space
Strings require O(n) space - where n is the string length
Reference types are generally O(n) where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects)

BIG O only cares about general trends, is it linear, quadratic, constant?
the time or space complexity (as measured by Big O
depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm.
Logarithms-inverse of exponentiation.
roughly measures the number of times you can divide a number by its base before you get to a value that is less than or equal to one.

log(8) = 3 (we are omitting the base which is 2 since that is the most common base we are saying that log means that it has a base of 2)
so we are asking 2 to what power is 8?

Certain searching algorithms have logarithmic time complexity.
Efficient solving alogrithms involve logarithms
Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity.
