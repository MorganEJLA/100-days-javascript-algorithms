Day #3 100days of code

Today I learned about Space Complexity in JS and how it is different from time. 
Most primitives are constant space (O)1 space
Strings require O(n) space  - where n is the string length
Reference types are generally O(n) where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects)
